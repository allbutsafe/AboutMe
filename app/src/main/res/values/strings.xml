    <string name="bio_contents">Hi,
        \nMy name is Nils,
        \nand I am trying to learn Kotlin, and with it write an app for Android.
        \n
        \nWith this, I want to become not a developer, but somebody being able to work in IT.
        \nBecause my current job\'s surround staled quite a bit, and I cannot move my place of work so easily,
        because the industry is down and nobody hires new people - they rather just all fire many of their people.
        \n\nThat\'s how it is and we have to live with it, somehow.
        \n\nStill not enough text.
        \n\nNow?
        \n\nNow!
        \n\n</string>
